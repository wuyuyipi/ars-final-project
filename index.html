          <p>There are so many different types of games on the market now, but there is one that has been a very influential and popular genre for over a decade, with hundreds of millions active players across the  the world.<sup>1</sup> It is MOBA, short for multiplayer online battle arena. The name of this game category already expresses a big part of the mechanics of the game, and all games under this category function in a similar way because of their same origin and some massively influential games like DOTA 2 and League of Legends in this category. Any player that knows how this category of games function can get into playing any MOBA game easily even if they don’t know about the background story. But why does League of Legends, such a representative MOBA game, have such a big universe and well developed story when players don't necessarily need to know the universe or story in order to play and become engaged? The universe is deeply rooted in the game while not having an obvious influence on the core gameplay, but still influencing the player community. As an influential game with a simple player versus player gameplay, League of Legends has a whole Universe of background story along with detailed illustrations that won’t affect the gameplay, but it does add to the game in many ways, it is overlooked, but can enrich the gameplay.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Background story of League of Legends doesn’t relate to the gameplay a lot. The gameplay of League of Legends is more strategy based and the experience of each match will be different because of the players. Unlike other games like the Role-Playing Game, also known as RPGs, not knowing the background story of League of Legends won’t become a block on the journey of players. The first comment under a YouTube video that is explaining the storyline of League of Legend, the most liked comment is “how can a game without a storymode has such a nice story”.<sup>2</sup> Even though League of Legends actually has story modes, this comment still proved that people don’t really acknowledge the other modes other than the classic one. The most commonly played mode, Summoner’s Rift, is five players versus another five players, and there are different lanes on the map. Players will pick different game characters, which are the champions with different abilities to control when entering the game. Those champions have lanes that they usually take based on their classification and abilities. The goal of this game is to destroy the Nexus in your enemy team’s base. And players will need to destroy Turrets and Inhibitors on the way, while clearing the jungle and defeating the monsters to get resources and bonuses with their team. Fighting with the other team is necessary when defending the Turrets and Nexus, or trying to take control of the jungle. Players will also get coins to buy gear and earn experiences to level up during the game through defeating enemies units and champions, and monsters in the map.<sup>3</sup> In fact, this is all that a new player will need to know to start playing the game. There isn’t any knowledge of the background needed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, there is a tab on the navigation menu on the League of Legends website, which is a link to a whole separate website on the universe of League of Legends, which includes all these different things and their story. Some of the stories about the champions are mentioned inside the game and the game website as well, but this Universe website also included more details and information about the regions along with illustrations and stories. In fact, the Universe website of League of Legend wasn’t published until December 2016, before that, the background story wasn’t a field that players easily can learn about. However, over the past few years, it has grown so much and fulfilled a lot of details, and became one of the three largest parts of the intellectual property of League of Legends, along with the game itself and E-Sport.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The most important thing for a game to stay active and influential is the player, and the background stories can help maintain and even increase the stickiness of players. There are players that care about “Why do we fight”. There is one redditor who brought up this interesting question “Does any MOBA, ever tried to honestly answered the question ,why there is this big fight, and this explanation got any sense?”.<sup>5</sup> According to this redditor, League of Legends is not doing a good job on explaining what the players are fighting for, but shows that there are players value the goal of the game, even if it is a simple player vs player battle game.The goal of the game can be reflected in the story and it is a very hot blooded part of the game play. Also while the background story expands over years, it can help keep attracting players' interest and attention, and willing to know more about the world. There is a Bilibili uploader -LKs-, who is known for making videos about the League of Legends story since 2016, and was also a former employee of the game publisher Riot Games explained his reason for interest in the background story. He mentioned that it is a separate part from the game of the intellectual property of League of Legends, especially when people can’t play as much because of all kinds of reasons, the background story can serve as a topic among them and can always recall their memory of them fighting together in the game.<sup>6</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, according to the result from a short survey done with players, most of them don’t actually care about the story, or won’t take time to go learn about the story, but they have favorite champions in League of Legends. They usually like them because of the abilities of the champion, but at the same time they mostly know at least a little bit about the story of the champion. Those stories of the champions help in connecting all the different parts of the story, and it is the part of the background story that is easier to find by the players. Most players have a preference of region as well, mostly because of the visuals, which are a part of the universe, and there are also obvious differences between the champions that are from different regions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another important part of a long lasting game is the complexity and possibility of the game to keep the interest of players. Only having a classic game mode is not enough for this. While having some story line, it is easier to develop some new game modes based on it. Other than the story mode mentioned before, there were also player versus environment modes, also known as PVE in League of Legends, and in most PVE games, there are certain goals that players need to accomplish, just like other role playing games.<sup>7</sup> The storyline allows the flexibility of creating them without needing to develop a whole new set of plot when adding a PVE mode. Especially for League of Legends, there is even this whole separate game called “Ruined King” which is a game that is based on the story of League of Legends, and it is available on a lot more platforms for players that are not a fan of computer games or MOBA games.<sup>8</sup> With the backbone of the Universe, it is also an option to make alt universes for the PVE modes, while two of the alt universes of League of Legends, Star Guardian and Odyssey are related to two PVE modes that had been released.<sup>9</sup>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Having a well designed universe can make it easier when trying to branch out. Riot Games produced this animation, Arcane, with the characters from League of Legends.<sup>10</sup> The animation is available on Netflix, and it is a masterpiece of animation that has attracted a lot of audiences.<sup>11</sup> In fact, the plot of the animation is not exactly matching what had been known from the Universe website and the game, but it is based on the regions and champions from the universe, with easter eggs relating to the game.<sup>12</sup> Some plots changed to fit in the context of the story of the animation, but the core of the personalities of champions and settings of the regions are the same as the Universe of League of Legends. It can attract people’s interest to learn about the rest of the story, which can be found on the universe website. And some people actually started playing the game because of the animation.<sup>13</sup> The animation also influences existing players by the champions they pick. The champions that played as main characters in Arcane got a higher picking rate when Arcane just released.<sup>14</sup> Also while considering it took at least six years to make this animation, which means it was done along the creation of the Universe, so it must be treated as a part of the whole story, and meant to provide some hidden information to the audiences.<sup>15</sup> While Arcane is so well done, it also draws interests of players that weren't as interested in the story, and start making people realize the attraction of the story of League of Legends, which was considered unnecessary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            League of Legends also plays a big part in the E-Sport events. League of Legends have large scale E-Sport competitions, but same as every other E-Sport events, there is always a long waiting time between each match, that is when the story comes into play a big part. It is a large topic for the commentaries to talk about during that time. Also while E-sport got designated as a sport by the International Olympic Committee, it got more influence on the common population, and for a lot of audiences that don’t really play the game, the background story is what they pay attention more to. Also, according to some players that stopped actually playing over time because of all kinds of reasons, they will still watch E-Sport, and they will value the background story, as connections to their memories, or a method to know the development of the game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In general, there are two main aspects that the universe is important even though a lot of players don’t care about it as much. One is the game design aspect, and the other is from the aspect of players. Game designers keep maintaining the universe even if a lot of players don’t care about it, because it can help the game design in many ways. It can keep the connection between all the very different champions, provide explanations and guide the visual designs. The rich background story creates more characteristics for the champions, and at the same time, the new champions added to the Universe can be more easily introduced through their background and their relationship with other champions. There are also players that value the background story, as a goal for them to “fight for”, and a good story line can help increase the stickiness of the players. Having a clear goal of what players are “fighting for” creates more emotional connections with the players. It is also an element that can attract new players though mediums other than the game itself, like animation series, film, or E-Sport events. Even when League of Legends released back in 2019 was criticized as a copycat because of the massive influencer at the time, DOTA 2 is a game of the same category, League of Legends still slowly proved itself and expressed the spirit of it to the player community, largely through the unique and well designed story. So, even the background story of League of Legends might be overlooked, but it shouldn’t be considered unnecessary, however, it helps the development of the game, ties the player community closer together, and enriches the whole intellectual property of League of Legends. Most importantly, as such a famous game, it has players from all over the world with different preferences and interests, there are always a part of them that want to explore the background story, and while the game have over hundreds of millions of players, there will be a big number of players that are interested in the story, and a successful game need to let all kinds of player find their own excitement in the game.
